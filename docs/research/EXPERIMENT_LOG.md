# Experiment Log

Every cluster job gets an entry: purpose, commit, job id, run directory,
resources, task/seed selection, outcome, and observations. Labels:
**Verified** (seen in outputs), **Interpretation**, **Speculation**.
Machine-readable submission records: `docs/research/jobs.tsv`.
Fetched run directories: `$LOCAL_RUNS` (outside git). Machine-specific
details (account, paths) stay in the private `site.env`, not here; runs
record only its SHA-256 (`manifest.json → site_env_sha256`).

## 2026-10-19 — Environment inspection (no jobs)

- **Purpose:** Phase 1 discovery on the login node, read-only.
- **Commands:** `sacctmgr`, `sinfo`, `module avail`, `conda env list`, `ls`,
  `curl` to `api.deepseek.com` and `huggingface.co`, reads of the installed
  vLLM 0.25.1 source (network binding).
- **Verified:** GPU partition with 8 × A40 nodes available to our account; no
  Qwen3.5-4B in cache; no ALFWorld data; DeepSeek reachable from the login
  node (401 without key); home quota nearly full; vLLM's single-GPU executor
  uses the node IP for its rendezvous unless `VLLM_HOST_IP` is set.
- **Changes on cluster:** none.
- **Compute used:** none. **API calls:** none.

<!-- Template for job entries:

## YYYY-MM-DD — <job name> (job <id>)

- **Purpose:**
- **Commit:** <sha>   **Snapshot:** snapshots/<sha12>
- **Run dir:** runs/<...>
- **Resources requested / used:** (from sacct)
- **Config:** configs/research/<file>.yaml + CLI overrides
- **Tasks / seeds:**
- **Outcome:** COMPLETED/FAILED/TIMEOUT/CANCELLED — what the outputs show
- **Scores:** native hard score(s)
- **Trajectory validity:** fallback actions by kind, genuine look, "Nothing happens.", format_invalid
- **Throughput:** requests, mean latency, gen tokens/s (vllm_throughput)
- **Gate:** action, selection scores
- **Tokens / est. cost:**
- **Deviations from plan:**
- **Observations / interpretation:**
